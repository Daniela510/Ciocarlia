Gramophone records consists of various music from Europe. It contains different types of genres such as Basque, pop music, cabaret, poetry, chansons, folk music from Alsace, Corse and Bretagne and Kurdish music.*" However this particular record is a romanian folk tune.

# Research
## The Audio 
The tune pressed onto the vinyl is called "*Ciocarlia*", it is itself a transcoding of a birds song to a musical score. There are diverse theories as to where it originates from but similar tunes are heard across the balkans and caucas. Below is an overview of some notabe interpreations, most are of romanian origin because the modern score that is recorded on the artifact is accredited to a Romainan-Gypsy musician. The tune is also part of the collective memory and identity of Romania. 

| Performer | Instrument | Relevancy | Link |
--|--|--|-- 
 **Nicu Stanescu** | Violin | This is the archived version. It seems to feature a recording of a performance from 1956, even though the vinyl record itself was pressed later. The lead performer was the founder of two well renowned romanian orchestras, one that focuses on folk music and another with an inclination to Lautari music with some overlap. Even though his performance of the Ciocarlia is neither his personal stand-out performance, nor the most renowed performance of Ciocarlia, given the popularity of both it explains why this version had such high chances of being archived and it was. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/v8O2xf5sexc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8O2xf5sexc) 
 **Grigoras Dinicu** |  Violin | As the most famous romanian-gypsy violinist his performnce of Ciocarlia is also the "default". He used the sheet music his grandfather, Anghelus Dincu, wrote pan-flute because it could showcase his impressive violin skills. He performed Ciocarlia in a number of European cities including London, Paris, Monte Carlo and Vienna. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0V3AAniGYMg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V3AAniGYMg) 
 **Anghelus Dinicu** | Pan-Flute | The romainan-gypsy performer is credited for writing the sheet music for Ciocarlia. The tune was aso peformed by him on pan-flute at the 1889 World Art Fair in Paris, the innauguraton of the Eiffel Tower. | No online recording of the performance is available
 **Gheorghe Zamfir** | Pan-flute | A return to the instrument the sheet music was written for. Zamfir re-introduced the pan-flute as a notorious musical instrument, he applied it to numerous music genres shaping the romainan folk-rock movement for example. He was awarded the with the medal of Vatican, the French order of cultural merit, and kinghted by Frane, Belgium and Luxemburg for his musical contributions to culture. He is most notable for performing folk songs, among witch is Ciocarlia. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dG6FHwRzl8w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG6FHwRzl8w)
 **George Enescu** | Violin | Georges Enesco, is considered to be the greatest Romanian musician. He was a composer, violinist, pianist, conductor, and teacher. He considered himself first and foremost a composer, but too few of his own compositions retain relevancy compared to his legendary persona remebered and told by his students and fellow musicians such as  Brahms, Bartok, Strauss, Ravel, Debussy and Shostakovich. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5Pn1X1_a64/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Pn1X1_a64)
 **Victor Copacinschi** | Ciambalom | Successful moldovian musician who embraced romanian folk music while living basarabia under communist rule witch opposed the native romaian folk and culture. His rendetion of Ciocarlia became more known recently since his daughter recieved a grammy in 2018 for "Best Chamber Music" and promoted this recording on her platform. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EflpsFjkzxU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EflpsFjkzxU)
 **Sons of Cordillera** | Pan-flute | The Vinyl was pressed by the same company that pressed the archived version. It is a recording that can be found on musical streaming services yet little can be found about the interpreters. |[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CqsVNotObQA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqsVNotObQA)
 **David Kipiani, Giorgi Tskhadadze, Malkhaz Qoiava** | Flute | Georgian performance of "Trolola", actually using the same sheet music as previous examples. |[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-xOpk5rVS3Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xOpk5rVS3Q)
  **Laza Tamburica** | Tambura | Serbian interpretation of "Seva" by local orchestra. Captures a more informal setting but still showcases great skill and talent. |[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jj9HZ8fbTvA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj9HZ8fbTvA)
  
### The bird
![](images/skylark.jpg)
It is a widespread species found across Europe and the Palearctic with introduced populations in New Zealand, Australia and on the Hawaiian Islands. It is a bird of open farmland and heath, known for the song of the male, which is delivered in hovering flight from heights of 50 to 100 metres (160 to 330 ft). The sexes are alike. It is streaked greyish-brown above and on the breast and has a buff-white belly.

The female Eurasian skylark builds an open nest in a shallow depression on open ground well away from trees, bushes and hedges. She lays three to five eggs which she incubates for around 11 days. The chicks are fed by both parents but leave the nest after eight to ten days, well before they can fly. They scatter and hide in the vegetation but continue to be fed by the parents until they can fly at 18 to 20 days of age. Nests are subject to high predation rates by larger birds and small mammals. The parents can have several broods in a single season.

## The Medium  
### Why Vinyl?

![](images/medium.jpg)
| Reason | Exapansion |
--|--
Awareness | This medium requiers more active listening and awareness of the circumstances and the recording. Letting a generated spotify playlist play borders on lack of action, while putting on a vinyl is a deliberate concious action.
Sound Quality |  Vinyl is able to reproduce really high fidelity sound, with little to no comression of the sound waves. There is a limit in volume both in the recording phase and the output, ironically this encouraged the preservation of the variety of ranges rather than aiming for a uniform loud record as was the tendency for CDs.
Tangible | It is physical, therfore sharebale and inheritable. It's physicality disqualifies points of discussion that are still debated about digital recordings, for example the gray area of inheriting purchased iTunes mp3 recordings.
Buying experience | Purchasing a new record comes with a hunt, and intention, it is a hobby and there is a community aspect to it too.

# Transcodings
Both the medium and the content are important in the exploration of transcodings. The artifact is a whole, while the transcodings explore parts of what interested me, deconstructing it without putting it back together, because the goal is not to recreate the artifact but to experience it. 

## Transcoding No. 1
### Analog to digital 
Unfortunately for all the reasons stated in [The Medium](#The-Medium) section above, in order to work with the content in a manageable way I had to first get a digital recording of the sound on it, transcoding it in the simplest way from it's analoge form to an mp3 recording. 
Later on I also dissected the first recording into parts, since because of the way it was made it was not just a duplication of the content, but had a narrative of its on containing other actions such as putting the vinyl on the bed, starting the output, etc. 

### Method & Tool
It was done in a tiny chamber in the IISG with only the vinyl and me moving, a capsule where all attention is on one thing, the recording. The digital version was recorded on my phone. Also used my phone to record  the space.
