## Research
### The Audio

The tune pressed on the archived vinyl record is a permonce of "Ciocarlia"

| Performer | Instrument | Relevancy | Link |
--|--|--|-- 
 **Nicu Stanescu** | Violin | This is the archived version. It seems to feature a recording of a performance from 1956, even though the vinyl record itself was pressed later. The lead performer was the founder of two well renowned romanian orchestras, one that focuses on folk music and another with an inclination to Lautari music with some overlap. Even though his performance of the Ciocarlia is neither his personal stand-out performance, nor the most renowed performance of Ciocarlia, given the popularity of both it explains why this version had such high chances of being archived and it was. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/v8O2xf5sexc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8O2xf5sexc) 
 **Grigoras Dinicu** |  Violin | As the most famous romanian-gypsy violinist his performnce of Ciocarlia is also the "default". He used the sheet music his grandfather, Anghelus Dincu, wrote pan-flute because it could showcase his impressive violin skills. He performed Ciocarlia in a number of European cities including London, Paris, Monte Carlo and Vienna. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/0V3AAniGYMg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V3AAniGYMg)

 **Gheorghe Zamfir** | Pan-flute | A return to the instrument the sheet music was written for.

 **George Enescu** | Violin | Georges Enesco, is considered to be the greatest Romanian musician. He was a composer, violinist, pianist, conductor, and teacher. He considered himself first and foremost a composer, but too few of his own compositions retain relevancy compared to his legendary persona remebered and told by his students and fellow musicians such as  Brahms, Bartok, Strauss, Ravel, Debussy and Shostakovich. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5Pn1X1_a64/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Pn1X1_a64)
 **Victor Copacinschi** | Ciambalom | Successful moldovian musician who embraced romanian folk music while living basarabia under communist rule witch opposed the native romaian folk and culture. His rendetion of Ciocarlia became more known recently since his daughter recieved a grammy in 2018 for "Best Chamber Music" and promoted this recording on her platform. | [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EflpsFjkzxU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EflpsFjkzxU)
