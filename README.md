This is the archived version. It seems to feature a recording of a performance from 1956, even though the vinyl record itself was pressed later. The lead performer was the founder of two well renowned romanian orchestras, one that focuses on folk music and another with an inclination to Lautari music with some overlap. Even though his performance of the Ciocarlia is neither his personal stand-out performance, nor the most renowed performance of Ciocarlia, given the popularity of both it explains why this version had such high chances of being archived and it was. | As the most famous romanian-gypsy violinist his performnce of Ciocarlia is also the "default". He used the sheet music his grandfather, Anghelus Dincu, wrote pan-flute to showcase impressive violin skills. He performed Ciocarlia in a number of European cities including London, Paris, Monte Carlo and Vienna. | The romainan-gypsy performer is credited for writing the sheet music for Ciocarlia. The tune was aso peformed by him on pan-flute at the 1889 World Art Fair in Paris, the innauguraton of the Eiffel Tower
